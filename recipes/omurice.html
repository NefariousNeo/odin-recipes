        <h2>Omurice (Japanese Omelette Rice)</h2>
        
        <p>
            Japanese omurice (オムライス) is a thin omelette wrapped around seasoned rice, 
            often flavored with ketchup or made as chicken rice. 
            The name comes from combining the words “omelette” and “rice.”

            Omurice is a Western-inspired dish that developed in Japan, with origins tracing back to the early 1900s. 
            In 1925, a chef at a Western-style restaurant in Osaka called Hokkyokusei 
            served a version that closely resembles the modern dish.
