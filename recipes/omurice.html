        <h2>Omurice (Japanese Omelette Rice)</h2>
        
        <p>Japanese omurice (オムライス) is a thin, soft-cooked omelette wrapped around seasoned Japanese ketchup rice (ケチャップライス) or</p>
        <p>chicken rice (チキンライス). The name itself is a catchy Japanese loanword that blends “omelette” and “rice.”</p>
    
        <p>This Western-style dish is unique to Japan, as it doesn’t exist in American or European cuisine.</p>
        <p>Several restaurants in Japan claim to have created omurice in the early 1900s.</p>
        <p>However, it was in 1925 that a chef in Osaka at a Western-style diner called Hokkyokusei</p>
        <p>created a dish very similar to the omurice that we know and love today.</p>
