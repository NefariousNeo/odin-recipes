        <h2>Gyudon (Japanese Beef Bowl)</h2>

        <p>
            Gyudon (牛丼) is a savory donburi (rice bowl) dish of thin pieces of tender fatty beef, onions, and a sauce of mirin
            and soy, served over rice. Sake is also sometimes added for extra flavor. Gyu means beef, while don refers to the bowl.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Neutral oil <em>(such as vegetable or canola oil)</em></li>
            <li>2 medium onions <em>(very thinly sliced)</em></li>
            <li>1 pound (450 g) very thinly sliced beef <em>(fatty beef chuck or ribeye)</em></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30 ml) mirin</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30 ml) soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup (235 ml) dashi stock <em>(can also substitute beef or chicken stock)</em></li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>4 cups (720 g) cooked white rice <em>(short grain or medium grain preferred)</em></li>
            <li>1 scallion <em>(chopped)</em></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds <em>(optional)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the neutral oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, and cook the sliced 
                onions for about 10 minutes, stirring often.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the beef and sugar, and cook until the beef is slightly browned. Add the mirin, 
                soy sauce, and stock. Bring to a simmer, and cook for about 10-15 minutes to reduce 
                the stock into a thin sauce. Taste for seasoning, and add a little more soy sauce if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat another couple tablespoons of oil in a cast iron or non-stick skillet. 
                Cook the eggs sunny-side up. You can cook them in batches if needed. The yolks should still be runny!
            </li>
            <li>
                When the beef is done simmering, divide the rice among serving bowls (the original recipe is for 4, so 4 bowls), 
                and top with the beef and an egg for each bowl. Garnish with chopped scallion and toasted sesame seeds, if using.
            </li>
        </ol>
