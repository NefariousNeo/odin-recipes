        <h2>Gyudon (Beef Bowl)</h2>

        <p>
            Gyudon (牛丼) is a Japanese rice bowl topped with thin slices of beef and onions simmered in a lightly sweet soy-based sauce, 
            often made with mirin and sometimes a splash of sake for depth. The name comes from gyu (牛) 
            which means beef and don (丼) which is short for donburi, or “bowl”.
