        <h2>Katsu Curry (Japanese Curry with Chicken Cutlet)</h2>

        <p>
            Katsu Curry (カツカレー) is a Japanese curry dish served with a breaded chicken cutlet on top. 
            It's typically made with a curry roux block, a common pantry item in Japan, 
            which is easy to find at Asian grocery stores or larger supermarkets.
