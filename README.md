# Project: Recipes

## What is this?

For my first web development project I had to research three recipes. Using only HTML, I created a website with four pages (including the homepage). Each page contains the name of the dish, an image, a description, ingredients, and instructions. These pages all have hyperlinks which allow users to navigate between the homepage and three recipe pages.

## What I learned

This project was fairly interesting for me. I was surprised how much you can build with just HTML, even without CSS or JavaScript. Despite not having the ability to change the font, colors, or layout of the pages, it is truly impressive how much can be done with just HTML. I decided to choose three Japanese dishes, two of which are western-influenced food (洋食). I discovered how creating a website feels more *interesting* to me, more so than just creating a text-based game in Python, because it involves more structure and critical thinking about how I want the website to look.

  * Absolute, relative
* Git and GitHub
* Detailed commits
* HTML Entities
